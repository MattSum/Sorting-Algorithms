# Sorting-Algorithms
Implementation of basic sorting algorithms. Source is mostly wikipedia.
I want to visualize all of them using matplotlib library.
Visualisation should, be different than simple barplot animation I used to see on YouTube.

I was instpired to make this reporitory by this article:
https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/

Of course my first attempt is to visualize algorithms by changing barplots but
I aspire to create a class framework for visualisation simillar to the one suggested in the answer of this question:
